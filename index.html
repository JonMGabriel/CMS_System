            <h1> Composite Design </h1>
            <p class="salmon">Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole
            hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and
            compositions of objects uniformly.</p>

            <h1> Flyweight Design </h1>
            <p>Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects
            efficiently.

            <h1>Prototype Design</h1>
            <p>Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance,
            and create new objects by copying this prototype.</p>

            <h1> Factory Design </h1>
            <p> Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide
            which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation </p>
